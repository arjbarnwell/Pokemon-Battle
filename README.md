Arden Barnwell Period 7 - Pokemon Battle Simulation Project:

In terms of user interaction, players will select a pokemon with LMB and then will be brought to the battle screen. Here, players will be able to click on a move with LMB, after which the system will select a move and carry out the current turn. This will repeat until a Pokemon is defeated, after which the ending screen will play.
